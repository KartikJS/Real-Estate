# Used Features

Axios for fetching data and using it dynamically from bayut api( Bayut is popular real estate website from UAE)
Didnt used Global State Management like Redux/Context API as there werent many components that needed to be updated.
Here is link to the API I used : https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/bayut

# ROADMAP FOR FUTURE

- Looking for Inspiration from popular Real Estate websites which have good user engagement for better layout.

- Implement new features such as authentication and bookmark/favorites through localStorage.

- Building Detailed Property Pages

- Redesigning Filter Tab.

- Using Swiper functionality while viewing properties so user can swipe through pictures without opening the product page

- Website for now is not responsive I plan to add media queries soon.

- CSS structure needs some improvements

# Few Missing Features and Drawbacks

- Note API only has 500 request per month if it doesnt work you can get it from above link or you can contact me.

- Location Search needs to be implemented

- User can select Min Value more than value of Max(doesnt display any results) which will be fixed in future (in Price and Area).

- Fallback Page/ Loading and error Handling.

# My Approach to building User Interfaces (OPTIONAL)

- Personally what I have learned is user interfaces arent the product or service in most cases they are means to sell product/Service. Hence whenever building UI developer should keep in mind who is the target consumer and that should be starting point of designing (for eg: luxury real estate website used gold/black colors, kids website are playful and colorful).UI shouldnt be a distraction I just learned web developer shouldnt innovate and I think that is true. For instance when you visit a website for shopping you expect the cart to be on top right. If a website tries to change that it will create a distraction, interupt the user engagement and user might not turn into customer.UI developer should improve and not go for radical innovation.
